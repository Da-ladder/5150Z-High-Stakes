# Final code release

Tbh this codebase is kinda messy, but have fun looking through it.

Some cool stuff:
- Motion profiling, located inside dlib. Dlib will be released by our org soon(TM)
- Vision and distance sensor alignment towards mogo
- The piston class, but most of its functions are integrated into pros now

Odd things:
- Using voltage control for curves, surprisingly consistent
- Switching between applying 0 volts and calculated voltage in motion profiling during decel phase
- 19 autos with 2700 lines of code for just the autos. ~7k lines of code in total


# What's going to happen to 5150Z?
All of our members graduate this year and we hope that the letter is retired from our org.
Our sister teams will continue to compete and we hope that someday another CT team will beat our record.
We could not have hoped for a better ending to our 3 year run. Thank you VEX and the community that surrounds it for everything.
And thank you 1698V for the best alliance we could've hoped for.



This codebase somehow got us to overall finalists.
